# ðŸŽ“ Forecasting Student Dropouts and Academic Success

This project predicts **student dropout risk** and **academic success** using data-driven machine learning models.  
It helps educational institutions identify at-risk students early and improve academic outcomes through actionable insights.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Load and preprocess student performance data  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visual insights  
- Train multiple **classification and regression models**  
- Evaluate model performance with metrics and graphs  
- Visualize **feature importance** and predictive factors  
- Interactive visualizations powered by **Plotly**

## ðŸ“¦ Installation & Setup

### 1. Ensure Python is Installed

Check if Python 3.8 or higher is installed:
```bash
python --version
If not, download it from python.org.

2. Open Terminal / Command Prompt
Navigate to your project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd "C:\Users\<YourName>\Documents\StudentDropoutProject"
3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
For Windows:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
4. Install Dependencies
Install all required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn plotly xgboost jupyter
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook
Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
6. Open and Run the Notebook
In Jupyter, open:

Copy code
Forecasting_Student_Dropouts_and_Academic_Success.ipynb
Run each cell in order (Shift + Enter) to execute.

ðŸ“Š What the Notebook Does
Loads and preprocesses the student dataset

Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Trains ML models for:

Classification: Predict dropout risk

Regression: Predict academic performance (e.g., final grades)

Evaluates models with accuracy, precision, recall, and RÂ² score

Visualizes results â€” feature importance, confusion matrix, performance metrics
